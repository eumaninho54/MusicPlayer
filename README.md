# MusicPlayer
A music player made entirely with python and pyqt, in addition to playing the songs, you can download them using Youtube URL. The images and banners were edited by me through After Effects. <s>YES I USE A VIDEO EDITING SOFTWARE AS AN IMAGE EDITOR</s> :).

## Context
 I was one more day listening to spotify and studying JS when I thought, dammit and if I try to develop a music player, WOOW cool.
